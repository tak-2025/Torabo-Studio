/**
 * Decides what a keymap binding should show on its keycap.
 *
 * The board used to draw `param1` as a HID usage unconditionally, which is only
 * right for `&kp`. Everything else drew blank or misleading: `&lt 2 A` drew the
 * *layer number* as if it were a usage (so the key looked empty), `&mt LSHFT Z`
 * drew the *modifier* rather than the letter it types, and `&to`, `&bt`, `&out`
 * drew nothing at all.
 *
 * None of this needs a table of behavior ids — which would be wrong anyway,
 * since behaviorIds are assigned per device. The firmware describes each
 * parameter in its metadata, including a display name for every constant it
 * accepts (behavior_bt.c, behavior_outputs.c), so the keyboard itself says what
 * its keys do. This reads that description:
 *
 *   param2 takes a HID usage   -> a hold-tap; param2 is the tap key
 *   param1 takes a HID usage   -> a key press; draw the usage (unchanged)
 *   param1 takes a layer id    -> draw the layer's name
 *   param1 matches a constant  -> draw that constant's name
 *
 * The hold-tap rule follows from how ZMK builds hold-tap metadata out of its two
 * child behaviors (behavior_hold_tap.c, hold_tap_parameter_metadata): param1 gets
 * the *hold* behavior's parameter and param2 the *tap* behavior's. So
 *
 *   Layer-Tap  bindings = <&mo>, <&kp>  ->  param1 = layerId,  param2 = hidUsage
 *   Mod-Tap    bindings = <&kp>, <&kp>  ->  param1 = hidUsage, param2 = hidUsage
 *
 * and "param2 accepts a HID usage" means "param2 is the tap key" for any
 * hold-tap the firmware defines, including custom ones.
